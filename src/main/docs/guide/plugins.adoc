If you create a Grails application with the `angularjs` profile you will see several
dependencies included in `build.gradle`.
 Some of those are of special interest while developing AngularJS application with Grails.

In particular you will see a project and buildscript dependency to the https://grails-plugins.github.io/grails-angular-scaffolding/latest/#_introduction[Grails Angular Scaffolding Plugin].
This plugin provides basic CRUD abilities using Angular in a single page application.

Read the http://grailsblog.objectcomputing.com/posts/2016/07/06/angular-scaffolding.html[Grails Angular Scaffolding blog post] to see an example.

Additionally the project contains several dependencies worth mentioning:
